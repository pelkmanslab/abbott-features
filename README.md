## Overview
The abbott-features Task Collection is intented to be used in combination with the [Fractal Analytics Platform](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform) maintained by the [BioVisionCenter Zurich](https://www.biovisioncenter.uzh.ch/en.html) (co-founded by the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the University of Zurich). 

The tasks in abbott-features are focused on extending Fractal's capabilities to extract features from (multiplexed) 3D image data.

## Available Tasks
| Task | Description | Passing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calculate Cycle Registration Quality | Calculates image-based registration quality across multiplexed OME-Zarr datasets.| ✓ |
| Measure Features | Calculates morphology, intensity, distance, and colocalization features for objects in a 3D label image.| ✓ |
| Get Cellvoyager Time Decay | Calculates time-decay correction factors per ROI, channel and acquisition to correct for acquisition bias dependent intensity decay (aka imaging snake).| ✓ |
| Get Z Decay Models | Calculates z-decay correction models per channel label to correct intensity decay across z.|✓|
