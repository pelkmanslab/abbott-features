### Purpose
- Calculates **intensity features** for objects in a 3D label image.
- Supports **3D measurements** across multiple regions of interest (ROIs).

### Outputs
- An **intensity feature table** saved in the OME-Zarr structure, containing:
- Intensity features (e.g., mean, median, minimum, maximum, sum etc.)
