### Purpose
- Calculates **colocalization features** for two channels per object in a 3D label image.
- Supports **3D measurements** across multiple regions of interest (ROIs).

### Outputs
- A **colocalization feature table** saved in the OME-Zarr structure, containing:
- Colocalization features (e.g., pearson-, spearman correlation, mutual information etc.)
